Yale-NUS College IT - Front-End Short Test
==========================================

**Test description:**

The objective of this test is to have you complete a short front-end task. Please use any industry standards, best practices, performance tips and code style that you support. 

**Requirements:**

1. All computation must take place on the client. Sorry no posting to the server, we want to see your front end skills.

2. To get started, fork this repo into your own GitHub account.

3. Without changing the existing form markup in `index.html`, create a script that on form submit prepends the contents of the from `<input type="text" name="post" placeholder="thoughts?"/>` to `<div id="page">`. 

4. For each input value prepended, concatenate the `second` of the current browser time (e.g. 55 secs) to the input value.

5. Once you finish coding, please inform HR that you have completed the test

We want to see your solution be done in JavaScript, jQuery or a similar JavaScript library. That being said if you feel strongly that this problem needs a framework by all means use one and tell us why and the advantages of using it.

**Example:**
